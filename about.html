<p>On April 3, 2020, I suddenly had an urge to make a blog and talk about 'stuff'. With the help of my little coding superpowers. Here is my bloggish thing! I still haven't decided on my theme yet, but we'll see.</p>

<p>The main reason of me starting this is to show some other sides of me, Veronica. You can see a more detailed explanation in my first post, but basically I don't want one part of me to define me. We all want to show parts of ourselves we want to show other people, but not the insecurities and worries. Here, I will try to comfortably open up and talk about stuff. I hope this won't be awkward cuz really, this is my place to talk and I get to do my own show. </p>

<p class="mb-5">I've always imagined myself as a stand-up comedian, talking about my anecdotes and unnecessary opinions (that no one asked). My time to shine. Hope I won't get cancelled for this.</p>
